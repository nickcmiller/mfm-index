SPEAKER_01:  High school there is putting the distribution of yearbooks on hold because a senior quote was actually an acronym for racial slur. Cappuccino High School in San Bruno had already handed out more than 100 yearbooks when this discovery was made yesterday. It's now asking those students to return them. We went to the high school tonight where there was a softball game and found some people were clearly angry about what had happened.

SPEAKER_00:  It's upsetting and it happens all the time. 72 years old and it's still happening. So it's not better, it's still happening.

SPEAKER_01:  The school is now in the process of covering up the offensive language in the remaining yearbooks with tape. The school says if students try to remove it, the page will tear. In a letter, the principal says in part, quote, I interviewed the student and they admitted that this was their intention. Using hate speech has serious consequences, which may include suspension, exclusion from year-end school activities, and the graduation ceremony.

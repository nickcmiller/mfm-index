SPEAKER_02: Thanks for joining us.Well, good afternoon. Yeah, former Chief Armstrong was shown the door basically from the police department last yearand now he's decided to get involved in city politics.

SPEAKER_02: Former Oakland Police Chief Leron Armstrong has announced that he is running for OrthoCity.He's running for a seat on the Oakland City Council.He filed the initial paperwork with the city clerk's office Wednesday morning.Armstrong says that he believes his experience as police chief qualifies him to sit on the council.

SPEAKER_00: You know, as our city experiences obviously dramatic increases in violence, budget issues, homeless issues,I think it's important that I bring my leadership to the table.

SPEAKER_02: Last year, Oakland Mayor Sheng Tao fired Armstrong from the police department for allegedly mishandling a pair of misconduct cases.He was later cleared of any wrongdoing.Armstrong has since filed a lawsuit against the city for wrongful termination.Even though that case has not yet been resolved, Armstrong says that he can work with the mayor if he's elected to the council.

SPEAKER_00: She made a decision. Obviously, I felt like it was not the right decision.And I've taken legal stance as a result of that.But throughout my entire time, I have not criticized the mayor.I have not been critical publicly about the mayor.I'm here to do a job and serve the public.

SPEAKER_02: Armstrong, who lives in District 7, is running for the at-large seat on the council,which is currently held by Rebecca Kaplan.Eight other candidates have also announced that they are running for that office.It's unclear at this point if Kaplan plans to try to keep her seat on the council.

SPEAKER_02: All right, back live now.the person who will fill that at-large seat will be decided in the upcoming Novembergeneral election. But for now, in the East Bay, Charles Clifford, Cron 4 News. Charles, thank you.
